Slite Integration Project - File Descriptions

This document provides an overview of each Python file in the Slite Integration project
and explains their primary purposes and functionalities.

1. slite_api.py
---------------
The core API integration module that handles direct communication with the Slite API.
It provides a comprehensive interface for creating, updating, and managing documents
and folders in Slite. The module includes event handling capabilities and implements
proper error handling for API responses. It serves as the foundation for all Slite
operations in the project.

2. note_manager.py
-----------------
A high-level manager class that provides a simplified interface for handling notes
and folders. It acts as a wrapper around the Slite API, adding additional
functionality like metadata management and error handling. This module makes it
easier to perform common operations without dealing directly with the API details.

3. text_to_json_converter.py
---------------------------
Specialized module for converting structured text meeting notes into a JSON format.
It handles parsing of meeting metadata, section organization, and hierarchical
content structure. The module is essential for maintaining consistency in how
meeting notes are stored and processed within the system.

4. utils.py
----------
Utility module providing common functionality used across the project. It includes:
- Logging configuration
- Rate limiting implementation
- Caching mechanisms
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Custom exception classes
These utilities ensure robust operation and proper error handling throughout the
application.

5. exceptions.py
---------------
Defines custom exception classes for handling various types of errors that may
occur during API operations. It includes specific exceptions for rate limiting,
authentication failures, resource not found errors, and validation issues.

6. models.py
-----------
Contains Pydantic models that define the data structures used throughout the
application. It ensures proper data validation and serialization for meeting
notes and folder structures, maintaining data integrity across the system.

7. cleanup.py
------------
Maintenance script for cleaning up test notes and maintaining a clean workspace.
It provides functionality to search for and remove test documents, helping to
keep the Slite workspace organized.

8. run_demo.py
-------------
Interactive demonstration script that showcases the capabilities of the Slite
integration. It provides a menu-driven interface for:
- Creating and managing documents
- Organizing folders
- Demonstrating event handling
- Testing automatic cleanup features
This script serves as both a demonstration and a testing tool for the integration.

Integration Architecture:
-----------------------
The project follows a layered architecture:
1. API Layer (slite_api.py) - Handles direct API communication
2. Business Logic Layer (note_manager.py) - Implements core functionality
3. Data Layer (models.py) - Defines data structures
4. Utility Layer (utils.py, exceptions.py) - Provides support functions
5. Interface Layer (run_demo.py) - Offers user interaction

This modular design ensures:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy maintenance and updates
- Scalable functionality
- Robust error handling
- Efficient resource utilization
